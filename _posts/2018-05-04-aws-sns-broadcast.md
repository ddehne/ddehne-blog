Recently, at a client site, my team was in need of integrating real-time broadcast capability to a browser-based interface (written in React). To achieve this, we decided on establishing a persistent websocket connection between the client interface and an EC2 instance running a Node.js server. The SNS topic would then send an HTTP Post to that server on broadcast. In this post I will guide you through the process of creating a bare-bones sample SNS real-time broadcast application for your front-end application of choice.

TL;DR hereâ€™s a Git repo with the completed project code.
