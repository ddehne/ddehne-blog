I've fallen out of the habit of reading, so I've challenged myself to 
read 10 books in 6 months. I'll check them off here and post a review 
of them as I finish.

Here's the compelete list:

1. ~~Eat That Frog *Brian Tracy*~~
2. Alexander Hamilton *Ron Chernow*
3. Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind *Yuval Noah Harari*
4. At Home *Bill Bryson*
5. The Audacity of Hope *Barack Obama*
6. The Restaurant at the End of the Universe *Douglas Adams*
7. The Count of Monte Cristo *Alexander Dumas*
8. Siddartha *Harmann Hesse*
